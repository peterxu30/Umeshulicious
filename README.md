A game where the player must press the correct key as it appears on the screen to prevent Professor Umesh Vazirani from getting into his zone. Special thanks to the Princeton Standard Library for making much of this possible.
Built for funsies. 

Side note: This game is purely fictional. We all know Professor Vazirani is always in his zone.
